CullLayers for Unity
====================

This utility use the Unity camera property called "layerCullDistances" to cull objects in 3d space. 
You just have to assign to your objects your own layers and use this utility to assign a distance (it's layer based).
It can make a huge impact in your project's frame rate if used properly.
